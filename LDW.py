    Applies weights to image data based on truth table patterns.
    This is a highly conceptual implementation due to the specificity of the request.

    Args:
        color_data_map (np.array): A 2D array of processed image data (e.g., color_diff_map or motion_indicator_map).
        truth_table_pattern (str): A string representing a truth table output column, e.g., "00010111" for 3-arity.
        pixel_to_proposition_map (dict): Maps (x,y) coordinates or regions to proposition IDs (P, Q, R).
                                         If None, a conceptual mapping is used (e.g., quadrants).

    # And "end of the first Sequence value remove" is also unclear.
    # For a simplified approach, let's just use the inverse of the change count.
    # Example: 00010111 -> changes: 0->1 (1), 1->0 (1), 0->1 (1), 1->1 (0) -> 3 changes

    # 3. "Most Significant and Least Significant Bit Columns Swapped (Bitwise Reverse)"
    # This applies to the *input* columns of a truth table (e.g., for PQR: P=MSB, R=LSB).
    # If the pattern is derived from the *output*, this needs clarification on how it's used.
    # If it refers to the logical meaning, it would need to map the image regions
    # to these input columns.

    # This part of the request implies a complex mapping from pixel positions
    # to specific truth table *rows* or *input columns*, and then applying
    # weights based on the processed truth table values.

    # Conceptual weighting:
    # Divide the image into regions that conceptually map to propositions (e.g., P, Q, R).
    # For a given pixel, determine its "propositional context" (e.g., it's in the "P" region).
    # Use the `color_data_map` (e.g., a measure of "redness" or "blueness") to assign
    # a "truth value" to that pixel's proposition.
    # Then use these "truth values" to look up a row in the `truth_table_pattern`.
    # The value from the `truth_table_pattern` then influences the pixel's weight.

    # This is *extremely* abstract and specific. I will implement a simpler
    # interpretation for demonstration:
    # Divide the image into N regions (where N = 2^arity, if arity is 2 or 3 for example)
    # Each region corresponds to a row in the truth table.
    # Weight the pixels in that region by the truth value (0 or 1) from the `truth_table_pattern`.
