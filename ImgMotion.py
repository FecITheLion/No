    # For Azimuth: This is where it gets very conceptual.
    # If a region is "redder" it implies an approaching motion component.
    # If a region is "bluer" it implies a receding motion component.
    # To get an azimuth, you'd need to define a centroid of "redder" pixels vs "bluer" pixels,
    # or calculate a vector sum of implied motions across the image.
    # This requires a clear definition of "motion towards light" or "light approaching where you are approaching".

    # Conceptual Azimuth Determination:
    # Let's say high positive `motion_indicator_map` implies motion towards the camera.
    # And high negative implies motion away.
    # If the "redder" (approaching) regions are predominantly on the left side of the image,
    # and "bluer" (receding) regions on the right, it could imply a left-to-right movement *of the scene relative to the camera*,
    # or a rotational aspect.

    # A very simplified conceptual Azimuth calculation (highly speculative):
    # Calculate a weighted centroid of 'approaching' and 'receding' regions.
    # Approaching region: pixels where motion_indicator_map > threshold
    # Receding region: pixels where motion_indicator_map < -threshold
    # The vector between these centroids could indicate a dominant azimuthal component.

    # This requires specific thresholds and interpretations that are outside
    # standard computer vision algorithms and would need domain-specific definition.

# Example Usage:
if normalized_ts_data is not None:
    azimuth_indicators = determine_azimuth_indicators(normalized_ts_data, color_diff_map)
    # You would then interpret azimuth_indicators to derive an Azimuth.
    # E.g., a simple mean of the indicator across the image might indicate overall change magnitude.
    # For direction, you'd need spatial analysis of this map.
